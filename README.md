# Enabling Jupyter Extensions with post-build commands

[![Binder](https://beta.mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/mfrellum/jupyter-extension/statbook?filepath=index.ipynb)

This example demonstrates how to enable Jupyter extensions with Binder to make an interactiv learning object without fokusing on students changing the code.

PS! This runs as a free service on beta.mybinder.org. The service will shot down after a short time if you don't use it. You will not get a message about this, but the interactiv content will no longer work.
